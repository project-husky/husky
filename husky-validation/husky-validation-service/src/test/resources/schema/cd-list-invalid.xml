            <p>The album was recorded in the midst of Coltrane's residency at the
                Five Spot as a member of the Thelonious Monk quartet. The personnel
                include Coltrane's once and future Miles Davis bandmates, Paul
                Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Pianist Kenny Drew had
                released a trio album the year before on Riverside Records with
                Chambers and Jones as his sidemen. Both trumpeter Lee Morgan and
                trombonist Curtis Fuller were up-and-coming jazz musicians, and both
                would be members of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, although not
                together.</p>
